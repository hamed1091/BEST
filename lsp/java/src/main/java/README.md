# Java Language server
Some classes are not included in the jar files. Instead, their actual source code is included. This is because I had to modify them for Android. 

# ClassBuilder
ClassBuilder is included in this module because it uses the `java.compiler` API (for building source code) and I did not want to create a new library module for that single classs.
